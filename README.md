# Brussels Smart City Monitoring Tool

## Overview
![App to update shelter occupancy](media/app_screenshot.png)

The Brussels Smart City Monitoring Tool is a real-time situational awareness platform designed to provide control room operators with a comprehensive view of urban mobility and emergency response across Brussels. Built as a fast, minimalistic, and highly responsive single-page application, it aggregates multiple data sources into an intuitive map-based interface.

The goal is to help people in the control room to have an understanding of the current situation to be able to beter react.

NOTE : CURRENTLY, ALL DATA ARE GENUINE EXCEPT FOR POLICE AND EMERGENCY VEHICULE AS WELL AS THE FILL LEVEL OF THE SHELTERS


The platform could be complemented with a mobile app where first respondant can update some real time metric, for example the number of remaining spot in a shelter.

**Source:** Mobility Twin Brussels API

Displays hourly vehicle counts on Brussels road segments, sourced from Telraam community traffic counters. Lines are colored by total traffic volume:

**Color Gradient:**
- **Cyan:** Low traffic (0-250 vehicles/hour)
- **Green-Yellow:** Moderate traffic (250-750 vehicles/hour)
- **Orange:** High traffic (750-1500 vehicles/hour)
- **Red:** Very high traffic (1500+ vehicles/hour)

**Interactive Details:** Click any road segment to view:
- üö¥ Bicycle count
- üöó Car count
- üöö Heavy vehicle count
- üö∂ Pedestrian count
- üìä Total count

### üöá STIB (Metro/Bus/Tram)
**Type:** Point Features with Icons (GeoJSON)  
**Update Frequency:** Every 5 seconds  
**Source:** Mobility Twin Brussels API (GTFS-RT)

Real-time positions of Brussels public transport vehicles. Each vehicle type is represented by a distinct icon:
- **Metro:** Subway icon
- **Tram:** Tram icon
- **Bus:** Bus icon

**Status Colors:**
- **Green:** On-time (85% of vehicles)
- **Orange:** Slightly delayed (10% of vehicles)
- **Red:** Significantly delayed (5% of vehicles)

### üöÜ SNCB (Trains)
**Type:** Point Features with Icons (GeoJSON)  
**Update Frequency:** Every 5 seconds  
**Source:** Mobility Twin Brussels API (GTFS-RT)

Real-time positions of Belgian railway trains in the Brussels region. Similar to STIB, trains are color-coded by their schedule adherence status.

### üöë Emergency Vehicles
**Type:** Animated Point Features (GeoJSON)  
**Update Frequency:** Every 1 second (animation)  
**Source:** Local trip simulation data

Displays animated emergency vehicle movements (ambulances, fire trucks) following pre-recorded trip paths. The animation loops continuously, providing a realistic simulation of emergency response patterns.

**Interactive Details:** Click any vehicle to view:
- Vehicle ID
- Current speed
- Heading direction
- Timestamp

### üöì Police Vehicles
**Type:** Animated Point Features (GeoJSON)  
**Update Frequency:** Every 1 second (animation)  
**Source:** Local trip simulation data

Similar to emergency vehicles, this layer shows police vehicle movements across Brussels, helping operators track law enforcement response patterns.

### üè† Shelters
**Type:** Point Features with Dynamic Icons (GeoJSON)  
**Update Frequency:** Static (loads once)  
**Source:** Local GeoJSON file

Displays emergency shelter locations across Brussels. Icons are:

**Size-coded by Capacity:**
- **Small icons:** <100 capacity
- **Medium icons:** 100-500 capacity
- **Large icons:** 500-1000 capacity
- **Extra-large icons:** 2000+ capacity

**Color-coded by Fill Level:**
- **Green:** Empty or low occupancy (0-25%)
- **Turquoise:** Moderate occupancy (25-50%)
- **Royal Blue:** High occupancy (50-75%)
- **Violet:** Near capacity (75-95%)
- **Purple:** At or over capacity (95-100%)

**Legend:** A dedicated legend appears in the bottom-right corner when the shelter layer is active, showing the color gradient and size scale.

**Interactive Details:** Click any shelter to view:
- Shelter name and type
- Full address
- Total capacity
- Current fill level
- Available spots
- Emergency contact information

### üì∑ Traffic Cameras
**Type:** Point Features with Icons (GeoJSON)  
**Update Frequency:** Static (loads once)  
**Source:** Local GeoJSON file

Displays traffic camera locations across Brussels. Each camera marker can be clicked to view:
- Live camera feed (when available)
- Camera status (active/inactive)
- Timestamp of last update
- Location details

## How It Works

### Layer Management
1. **Toggle layers** by clicking on them in the layer control panel (top-left)
2. **Active layers** are highlighted with a gradient background and filled indicator
3. **Multiple layers** can be active simultaneously
4. **WMS layer selection** appears when the Satellite layer is activated

### Data Updates
- **Dynamic layers** (STIB, SNCB, Telraam) refresh automatically every 5 seconds
- **Animated layers** (Emergency, Police) update positions every 1 second
- **Static layers** (Shelters, Cameras) load once for optimal performance
- **No loading indicators** to maintain a clean, uninterrupted interface

### Map Navigation
- **Pan:** Click and drag the map
- **Zoom:** Mouse wheel or pinch gesture
- **Navigation controls:** Available in the top-right corner
- **Fullscreen mode:** Toggle from the top-right controls

### Interactive Features
- **Click markers/lines** to view detailed information in popups
- **Hover over layers** to see cursor change indicating interactivity
- **Select WMS products** from the dropdown when satellite layer is active
